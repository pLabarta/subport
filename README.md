# Subport
### [Substrate](https://substrate.dev)(-based) chains usage and development support

## How to get the Support you Need:

### :book: **Read our Docs & Try our Tutorials**
- [The Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/)
  - Concepts and Archetechture of Polkadot applies to many substrate based blockchains!
- [Substrate Devhub](https://substrate.dev/)
  - [Knowledge base](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/) for concepts, terms, and more
  - [Tutorials](https://substrate.dev/en/tutorials) to try things out
  - [Recipes](https://substrate.dev/recipes/) to get examples to put into your custom solution & pro tips
  - [Rustdocs](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs) for the API that substrate exposes (and more)
- [Substrate Codebase](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)
  - Searching the source on your own machine can help a lot, if the rustdocs don't satify your needs.

### :family: **Join the [Substrate Technical Chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org)** on [matrix](https://matrix.org)
  - The community there is *amazing* and very helpful! Anyone with a `@<user>:matrix.parity.io` is a parity team member that can help troubleshoot as well.
  - Please ask general questions and report minor issues there about substrate and development with it **before you post in stackoverflow or github (more below)**.
  - We can direct you from there to topical channels there for things like testnets, faucets, other parity projects, and more.

### :thinking: **Submit a question** for review and support
- For anything that doesn't get addressed immediately in the chat, as it is quite active and sometimes gets lost in there: 
- Please **first search** :eyes: for your question or error on [Stack Overflow (tagged `substrate`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate))
  - If you don't find a solution, then please post a new one, and be sure to tag it `substrate` at a minimum (also `blockchain`, `polkadot-js`, and any other relevant flags)
- For more broad problems, **first search** :eyes: in [both **open and closed** issues](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues?q=is%3Aissue), then if you can't find an answer, please report them here by [opening an issue](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues/new)

### :bulb: **Start a discussion** on general usage questions and feature requests
- We are always looking for great ideas and great people to discuss them with! [Substrate Technical](https://app.element.io/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org) is the best place for short form, where [discussions here](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/discussions/) are better for topic specific long form discussions.
- Please first [look at open discussions](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/discussions/) and if there isn't one on the topic you are curious about, go ahead and [start a discussion](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/discussions/new) :family:
