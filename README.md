## How to Get Help:

### :book: Read our Docs & Try our Tutorials
- [The Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/)
  - Concepts and Archetechture of Polkadot applies to many substrate based blockchains!
- [Substrate Devhub](https://substrate.dev/)
  - Knowledge base for concepts, terms, and more
  - Tutorials to try things out
  - Recipes to get examples to put into your custom solution & pro tips
  - Rustdocs for the API that substrate exposes (and more)
- [Substrate Codebase](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)
  - Searching the source on your own machine can help a lot, if the rustdocs don't satify your needs.

### :family: Join the [Substrate Technical](https://app.element.io/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org) matrix chat channel
  - The community there is *amazing* and very helpful! Anyone with a `@<user>:matrix.parity.io` is a parity team member that can help troubleshoot as well.  
  - Please ask general questions and report minor issues there about substrate and development with it **before you post here**.
  - We can direct you to topical channels there for things like testnet, faucets, other parity projects, and more. 

### :thinking: Anything that isn't addressed immediately, please use post a question or error report on [Stack Overflow (tagged `substrate`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate)
### :confounded: For more broad problems, seach in [open and clossed issues](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues?q=is%3Aissue) **first** (and on stack overflow), then if you can't find an answer, please report them here by [opening an issue](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues/new)

### :bulb: For longer form ideas and feature requests, first [look at open discussions](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/discussions/) and if there isn't one, [start a discussion](https://github.com/paritytech/subport/discussions/new) :family:
